## Overview

Optimization is at the heart of artificial intelligence. From training neural networks to controlling autonomous systems, optimization algorithms drive innovation across industries.

## Key Insights

### 1. Gradient-Based Methods
Modern deep learning relies heavily on gradient-based optimization. Techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam have revolutionized how we train neural networks.

### 2. Convex vs Non-Convex Optimization
Understanding the landscape of optimization problems is crucial:
- **Convex problems** have unique global optima
- **Non-convex problems** are more complex but often more realistic

### 3. Model Predictive Control
MPC combines optimization with control theory, enabling real-time decision-making in dynamic systems.

## Real-World Applications

✅ Autonomous vehicles use optimization for path planning  
✅ Energy systems optimize power distribution  
✅ Manufacturing systems use MPC for process control  

## Future Directions

The convergence of optimization theory and machine learning continues to open new possibilities for solving complex engineering problems.
