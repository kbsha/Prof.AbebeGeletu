## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning has transformed how we solve problems across domains. This guide provides a foundation for understanding ML concepts.

## Three Main Types

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learn from labeled data to make predictions:
- Regression (predicting continuous values)
- Classification (predicting categories)

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Find patterns in unlabeled data:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learn through interaction and rewards:
- Agent-based systems
- Autonomous control

## Essential Concepts

- **Features**: Input variables for the model
- **Labels**: Target outputs in supervised learning
- **Training**: Process of fitting the model to data
- **Validation**: Testing model performance on new data

## Getting Started

✅ Start with Python and libraries like scikit-learn  
✅ Practice with publicly available datasets  
✅ Understand the theory before diving into deep learning  

## Conclusion

Machine learning is a vast field with continuous growth and innovation. Start small, practice consistently, and gradually tackle more complex problems.
