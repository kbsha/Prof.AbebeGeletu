## Key Insights

### 1. Gradient-Based Methods
Modern deep learning relies heavily on gradient-based optimization. Techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam have revolutionized how we train neural networks.

### 2. Convex vs Non-Convex Optimization
Understanding the landscape of optimization problems is crucial:
- **Convex problems** have unique global optima
- **Non-convex problems** are more complex but often more realistic

### 3. Model Predictive Control
MPC combines optimization with control theory, enabling real-time decision-making in dynamic systems.
